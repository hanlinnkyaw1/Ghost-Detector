# 📡 Ghost Radar Detector👻 (Web App)

This is a futuristic, radar-themed web app powered by TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD that detects real-world objects and occasionally spawns eerie ghost signals. The UI mimics a ghost-hunting scanner with blips, sweep animations, ghost voices, and a sci-fi interface.
